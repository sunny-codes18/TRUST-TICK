## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects a company (e.g., Apple, Google, Reliance)
2. The app fetches recent historical data using `yfinance`
3. Calculates 50-day and 100-day moving averages
4. Generates a line plot with signals and suggests investment insights
5. Shows it all in a simple Flask-powered dashboard
